          <p class="about-p">
            <strong>Hi!</strong> I like to challenge myself, learn new things and I love live music!<br>Right after I finished school, I've developed websites and used tools like Joomla! And Prestashop to create e-commerce experiences, so it has always been a passion of mine. I strive to stay on the cutting-edge of web design and development, that's why, after many job experiences in another areas, I've started a Web & Mobile Developer course.</p><hr><p class="about-p">
            During my current experience as a Web & Mobile Developer student, I'm learning more about Frameworks, like Laravel and Angular, to apply my knowledge about HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAPS, PHP, JAVASCRIPT and JAVA. As a web developer, I would bring these skills to develop websites that exceed the expectations of clients and customers and drive real business results.
